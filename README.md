> A [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux/) architecture implementation out of enjoyment of [Bacon.js](https://baconjs.github.io/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Want to achieve
- Reactive all the way from action to React component.
- Redux time travel through middleware and reducer.
- Utilise stateless functional React component.
